1. You need to plot all 10 points first
for example when you select Femur Center("all other selections are disabled") to plot you need to finalise the position using transalation control and then uncheck the box to plot next point, only on uncheck all other checkboxes are activated.

2. Then after ploting all 10 points you can see the update btn is visible

3. Clicking update btn will draw lines and a plane
